In honor of the long awaited (by me) inauguration of my blog, I thought I would outline a basic how to guide for setting up a blog in 10 minutes. Why on earth would I add ANOTHER how-to guide to the inumerable that already exist? Written from the perspective of someone not as familiar with front end development, I hope to provide a clearly explained guide that also touches on what the user is doing. If you are someone new to setting up a blog and like to understand both the "why" and the "how", read on, comrades.

V The Hard Part

Part I Hosting using Github Pages
If you want to host your website on the internet so other people can read it, I would recommend hosting using Github Pages. Github Pages are public, nonsecure webpages hosted and published using github. 

Install Ruby 2.2.0. To, install I used rvm wich is a ruby version manager. I highly recommend installing rvm if you don't have it. Using the command line, run:
```
curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
rvm install ruby-2.2.0
```
Choose a platform to serve your blog. I used Github pages, but another option is hosting your website on Heroku.
